# VHDL_LIFT_CONTROLLER
The elevator control system functions as a finite state machine (FSM). An FSM is characterized by a collection of states, a starting state, and specific inputs that trigger transitions between states. Based on particular inputs, the FSM may shift from one state to another, a process known as a transition.
